# Using this notebook:
# To run any of the following cells of code, you can type Shift + Enter to excute the code in a cell.
# Get the Python version installed
# Read the data from the IBM server into a pandas dataframe:
import pandas as pd # download library to read data into dataframe
pd.set_option('display.max_columns', None)
recipes = pd.read_csv("https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-DS0103EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/Module%202/recipes.csv")
print("Data read into dataframe!") # takes about 30 seconds
# Show the first few rows.
recipes.head()
# Get the dimensions of the dataframe.
recipes.shape
# So our dataset consists of 57,691 recipes. Each row represents a recipe, and for each recipe, the corresponding cuisine is documented as well as whether 384 ingredients exist in the recipe or not beginning with almond and ending with zucchini.
# Now that the data collection stage is complete, data scientists typically use descriptive statistics and visualization techniques to better understand the data and get acquainted with it. Data scientists, essentially, explore the data to:
# •	understand its content,
# •	assess its quality,
# •	discover any interesting preliminary insights, and,
# •	determine whether additional data is necessary to fill any gaps in the data.
